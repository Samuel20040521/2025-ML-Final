## Detailed Analysis
================================================================================

### Key Observations:

1. **Angular Difference (Overall)**:
   - Non-uniform (power-law) schedule shows HIGHER mean angular difference
   - This indicates larger velocity changes between consecutive evaluations
   - This is expected because power-law concentrates steps near t=0 where
     the velocity field changes rapidly from noise to signal

2. **Early Phase Angular Difference**:
   - Non-uniform shows SIGNIFICANTLY higher early angles (up to 4x baseline)
   - At t=0, the first evaluation shows ~90° difference (perpendicular velocities)
   - This is because:
     a) t^gamma (gamma=3) compresses early time steps extremely near t=0
     b) At t≈0, the flow field transitions from pure noise to data-directed flow
     c) The time warp applies different scaling to the velocity via chain rule

3. **Mid/Late Phase Angular Difference**:
   - Both methods show similar performance in mid/late phases
   - Non-uniform is slightly better (lower angles) in these regions
   - This suggests the time warp successfully allocates fewer steps
     where the velocity field is smoother

4. **Curvature (L2 Velocity Difference)**:
   - Non-uniform shows 2-3x higher curvature values
   - This correlates with the higher angular differences
   - The velocity magnitude also increases significantly with time warp

### Interpretation:

The power-law time warp (gamma=3) applies a reparameterization tau = t^gamma.
This means:
- A uniform grid in t becomes a front-dense grid in tau (physical time)
- The velocity is scaled: v_new(x, t) = (d_tau/dt) * v_old(x, tau)
- d_tau/dt = gamma * t^(gamma-1), which is small near t=0 and large near t=1

The **higher angular differences in early evaluations** suggest that:
1. The time warp is correctly concentrating samples in the high-curvature region
2. However, the velocity scaling amplifies the apparent curvature
3. The comparison may not be directly fair without normalizing for the schedule

### Recommendations for Phase 1:

1. **Separate time grid from velocity scaling**: The current implementation
   uses ScheduleTransformedModel which modifies both the time grid AND
   the velocity. For a fair comparison, consider:
   a) Using a non-uniform time grid without velocity transformation
   b) Implementing front_dense_schedule() as planned in Plan.md

2. **FID evaluation**: Add image quality metrics to measure actual
   sample quality, not just velocity smoothness

3. **Curvature-based schedule**: Use the baseline curvature data to
   design an adaptive time grid that places steps where curvature is high
